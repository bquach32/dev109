    <h1>Project name: JustType</h1>
    <h3>Project Description:</h3>
    <p>A website designed to help users improve their typing speed. The site will 
      generate a random sentence for the user to type within a limited time. If a 
      word is misspelled, the mistake will be highlighted in real time. Upon 
      completion, the right side of the screen will display the user's accuracy, 
      time, and score. Users will also have the option to try again.</p>
    <h3>Purpose: </h3>
    <p>A simple and engaging website designed to help developers practice coding 
      while allowing both developers and users to improve their typing speed. 
      Additionally, it fosters collaboration and teamwork skills among developers, 
      making it an effective platform for skill enhancement and cooperative learning.</p>
